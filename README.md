#### By _**Travis Toal**_

## Description

_Me: A beginning coder_
_You: A bored visitor, with a fear of the first three integers and a penchant for 2001:ASO quotes_

_beep-boop is a simple page that lets you input your name and number and see the number line up to that point. All numbers with a '3' are replaced by HAL-9000, all other numbers with a '2' are replaced by 'boop's, and all other numbers with a '1' are replaced by 'beep's. It will address you by name, or if you refrain from entering a name, by Dave._
