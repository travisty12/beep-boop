# _Beep Boop_

#### _Your arrays and loops do WHAT?? (EMOTIONAL) (NOT CLICKBAIT) 1/25/2019_

#### By _**Travis Toal**_

## Description

_Me: A beginning coder_

_You: A bored visitor, with a fear of the first three integers and a penchant for 2001:ASO quotes_

_YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT_

_beep-boop is a simple page that lets you input your name and a number and see the number line up to that point. If that line would include some specific integers, special things happen. It's just fizzbuzz, with some spice._

## Specs

* _**Spec**: The program returns a range of numbers from 0 to the user's inputted number_
  * _**Input**: "5"_
  * _**Output**: "0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5"_


* _**Spec**: The program returns 'Beep!' if it encounters a number with a '1' in any digit_
  * _**Input**: "1"_
  * _**Output**: "0, Beep!"_


* _**Spec**: The program returns a 'Boop!' if it encounters a number with a '2' in any digit, overriding the previous spec_
  * _**Input**: "12"_
  * _**Output**: "0, Beep!, Boop!, ...[6 more responses]..., 9, Beep!, Beep!, Boop!"_


* _**Spec**: The program returns a 2001: A Space Odyssey quote if it encounters a number with a '3' in any digit, overriding the two previous specs_
  * _**Input**: "123"_
  * _**Output**: "0, Beep!, Boop!, I'm sorry [name], I'm afraid I can't do that, 4, ...[114 more responses]..., Beep!, Boop!, Boop!, Boop!, I'm sorry [name], I'm afraid I can't do that"_


* _**Spec**: The program greets the user if it encounters a number divisible by 7_
  * _**Input**: "7"_
  * _**Output**: "0, Beep!, Boop!, I'm sorry [name], I'm afraid I can't do that, 4, 5, 6, Good morning, [name]"_


* _**Spec**: The program addresses the user by the name inputted to the name field (defaulted to 'Dave' if left blank)_
  * _**Input**: "Dave", "3"_
  * _**Output**: "0, Beep!, Boop!, I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that"_


* _**Spec**: The program reverses the outputted list upon clicking the 'reverse' button_
  * _**Output** [pre-reverse]: "0, Beep!, Boop!"_
  * _**Output** [reversed]: "Boop!, Beep!, 0"_


* _**Spec**: The program gives little 2001 easter eggs with different inputs_
  * _they're secret_
  * _find them yourself_

## Known Bugs

_When the bottom well teaser is clicked, it doesn't appear to fade out. Rather, it waits the 400ms the fadeOut animation takes, and then disappears abruptly while the bottom well fades in correctly. The foil animation, where the bottom well fades out and the teaser fades in, occurs correctly. If you know why, contact me._
